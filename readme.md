# Exercise: Color API

Using the Resource endpoint, you can set the word "unknown" in the url to be any value.

It will return data about colors.

- Generates a random number between 0 and 20.
- Fetches a colour, with that number as the id: https://reqres.in/api/color/:id -> https://reqres.in/api/color/15
- If the request succeeds, adds background of the fetched color.
- If it fails, adds a grey background to the HTML div.
